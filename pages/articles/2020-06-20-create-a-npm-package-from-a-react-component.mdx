> In this tutorial, we'll learn how we can create a package from an existing React component. We'll also learn how to publish it to [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/) so that other developers can use our package.


## Table of Contents

## Introduction
We'd developed a Pagination component in one of our [previous posts](https://nirmalyaghosh.com/articles/how-to-create-an-accessible-pagination-component-with-react). We'll be using that component and converting it into a NPM package.

> You'll need a [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/) account before you can publish a package there. Before we get started, it's recommended to create an account on NPM. You can create [unlimited public packages](https://www.npmjs.com/products) on NPM.


## Adding NPM information to our local environment
First, we need to [add a registry user account](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/adduser) on our local machine. On our terminal, we need to execute the following command:

```bash
npm adduser
```

The above command will create or verify a user named `<username>` in the specified registry, and save the credentials to the **.npmrc** file. More information regarding the above command can be obtained [from NPM docs](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/adduser).

We'll see a similar output on our terminal.

Now, if we type the command below, we should be able to view our NPM username:

```bash
npm whoami
```

## Initializing NPM with our package
We can use the following command to create a **package.json** file which is necessary for publishing a package to NPM:

```bash
npm init
```

More information regarding the above command can be obtained [from NPM docs](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/init).

> If you already have a **package.json** file with your project, you can skip the above step.

Here's a reference to our current **package.json** file:

```json:package.json
{
  "name": "react-pagination-component",
  "version": "0.0.1",
  "description": "A simple pagination component for React.js",
  "main": "index.js",
  "author": "Nirmalya Ghosh (nirmalya.email@gmail.com)",
  "license": "MIT",
  "private": false,
  "scripts": {
    "start": "parcel index.html",
    "build": "parcel build index.html"
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "react": "^16.13.1",
    "react-dom": "^16.13.1",
    "theme-ui": "^0.3.1"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "@babel/core": "^7.10.2",
    "@babel/package-transform-runtime": "^7.10.1",
    "@babel/preset-env": "^7.10.2",
    "@babel/preset-react": "^7.10.1",
    "@babel/runtime": "^7.10.2",
    "parcel-bundler": "^1.12.4"
  }
}
```

## Publishing our package to NPM
The final step would be publishing our package to NPM.

```bash
npm publish
```

The above command will publish our package to NPM. More information regarding the above command can be obtained [from NPM docs](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/publish).

![NPM publish error](/images/content/create-a-npm-package-from-a-react-component/3.png)

It's possible that we might see the above error when we're trying to publish our package. This means that there is already a published package named **react-pagination-component** on NPM. So, we'll need to rename our package.

> You can search for packages in NPM using the [`npm search <package-name>`](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli-commands/search.html) command.

In this case, we can rename our package from **react-pagination-component** to **reactjs-pagination-component** in our **package.json** file:

```json:package.json
{
  "name": "reactjs-pagination-component",

....
```

Now, if we try to publish again, everything should work fine:

```bash
npm publish
```

The above command will generate an output similar to the following:

![NPM publish](/images/content/create-a-npm-package-from-a-react-component/4.png)

Now, we can see that our package [has been published to NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/reactjs-pagination-component).

## Conclusion
In this tutorial, we learnt how we can convert an existing React component into a package and publish it to NPM. We'll be learning more about how to publish updates to our package and release them in a separate tutorial.
